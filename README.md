# Arduino LED Matrix Controller
A project for controlling the Arduino LED Matrix through serial commands. This code allows you to display, animate, and manipulate patterns on the matrix with simple text commands.

# Features
Display predefined patterns

Turn the matrix on/off

Invert displayed pattern (swap)

Animate patterns with left and right shifting

Serial command interface

Hardware Requirements
Arduino board with LED Matrix (e.g., Arduino UNO R4 WiFi)

Arduino_LED_Matrix library

Installation
Connect your Arduino board to your computer

Install the Arduino_LED_Matrix library via the Arduino Library Manager

Upload this sketch to your board

Open the Serial Monitor (set to 9600 baud)

# Usage
After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor and send one of the following commands:

On - Display the predefined pattern

Off - Clear the matrix

Swap - Invert the displayed pattern

Left - Start left-shifting animation

Right - Start right-shifting animation

For animations, type any character in the Serial Monitor to stop the animation.

Code Overview
The project uses bit manipulation to control the 12Ã—8 LED matrix. Key functions include:

HexBin(): Converts hexadecimal frame data to binary strings

BinHex(): Converts binary strings back to hexadecimal format

Animate_Right(): Shifts the pattern to the right

Animate_Left(): Shifts the pattern to the left

Circuit Diagram
No external wiring is needed as this uses the built-in LED matrix on compatible Arduino boards.

Customization
You can modify the frame array to create your own patterns:

uint32_t frame[] = {   
  0x3184a444,   // Modify these values
  0x42081100,   // to create your
  0xa0040000    // own patterns
};
